This work is part of my project for the course Microprocessor and Interfacing (CSE2006) at VIT Chennai. I did this project along with two other members in my 2ND year. 

PROJECT TITLE: Morse Code Encoder and Decoder

OBJECTIVE: To make an interpreter to send and receive Morse Code using Arduino

PROJECT DESCRIPTION:
The Morse code encoder takes input using the keyboard in English and converts it to Morse code. The converted morse code can be seen on the serial monitor, heard as beeps using the buzzer and signalled using a blinking LED. 
The Morse code decoder takes input using a button, a longer press represents a dash whereas a short one is for a dot. The LED blinks when we feed in the input in morse code. The converted code in English is visible on the Serial monitor.
